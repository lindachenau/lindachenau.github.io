Because there are two separate native code bases, the maintenance cost\nis high. Besides users have to take an extra step to download the new mobile app release.\nUnless a mobile app is well designed and needed to be accessed very frequently (e.g. several\ntimes a day), most users would choose to just use the responsive website on their mobile\nphones to avoid the hassle of downloading and adding clutter to their mobile home screen.</p>\n<p>PWAs rival the performance of native apps but require much less device storage. Many leading\ncompanies utilise PWAs in their digital strategies. Those which replaced their existing websites\nwith PWAS, have shown significant increase in user engagement on their new websites.</p>\n<p>Since PWA has a common code base across multiple mobile platforms, it is easier to maintain\ncompared to Native apps. It also removes future app store approval hassle and provides users\nwith the benefit of zero installation. Whether you plan to build a new web app or upgrade your\nexisting web app, PWAs is the most cost effective solution to cater for both desktop and mobile\nusers.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Progressive Web Apps (PWA)","keywords":"javascript"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/progressive-web-apps/"}}}
